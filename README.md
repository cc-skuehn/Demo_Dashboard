# Demo_Dashboard

This is an interactive Demo Dashboard in R using flexdashboard, shiny, plotly and ggplot.

## Usage

The Dashboard comes as a set of .Rmd or RMarkdown files plus some standard R scripts. In order to run it you need to have certain packages and most probably it is a good idea to have RStudio and R version 3.4.x installed 

### Packages

* markdown
* knitr
* flexdashboard
* ggplot2
* plotly
* shiny
* CausalImpact
* prophet

Some of these packages will install further packages.

### Starting the Dashboard

After installing the packages and once you have downloaded the source files from this repository (or cloned/forked the repository, whatever you prefer, but don't forget the Data folders), open the file "Demo_Dashboard.Rmd" with RStudio and click on "Run Document".

In case this does not work out of the box, try changing the working directory to the file's directory first: Session -> Set Working Directory -> To Source File Location
